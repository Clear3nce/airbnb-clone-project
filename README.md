# Frontend Answers.

## UI/UX Design Planning.

### Project overview

- This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.


### Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design


### Design goals and the key features that need to be implemented.

- Maintain visual consistency.
- Ensure fast loading times.
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness.
- Create intuitive booking flow.

### Key features.

- Property search and filtering.
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary pages.

- Property Listing View : grid display of available properties with filters.
- Listing Detailed View : Complete property details with images and booking form.
- Simple Checkout View : Streamlined payment and booking confirmation.

### Importance of User-Friendly Design.
- A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.


### Color Styles:

Primary: #FF5A5F
Secondary: #008489
Background: #FFFFFF
Text: #222222
Secondary Text: #717171

### Typography:

Primary Font: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
Headings: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px
Secondary Text: Circular, Book (400), 14px

### Importance of identifying design properties of a mock-up design are:
 1. Effective communication, aligning stakeholders.
 2. early Problem detection, minimising costly errors later in the development.
 3. building design confidence.
