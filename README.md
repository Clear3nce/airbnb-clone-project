# Frontend Answers.

## UI/UX Design Planning.

### Project overview

- This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.


### Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design


### Design goals and the key features that need to be implemented.

- Maintain visual consistency.
- Ensure fast loading times.
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness.
- Create intuitive booking flow.

### Key features.

- Property search and filtering.
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary pages.

- Property Listing View : grid display of available properties with filters.
- Listing Detailed View : Complete property details with images and booking form.
- Simple Checkout View : Streamlined payment and booking confirmation.

### Importance of User-Friendly Design.
- A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.


### Color Styles:

Primary: #FF5A5F
Secondary: #008489
Background: #FFFFFF
Text: #222222
Secondary Text: #717171

### Typography:

Primary Font: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
Headings: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px
Secondary Text: Circular, Book (400), 14px

### Importance of identifying design properties of a mock-up design are:
 1. Effective communication, aligning stakeholders.
 2. early Problem detection, minimising costly errors later in the development.
 3. building design confidence.

## Project Roles and Responsibilities.

1. Project Manager ->	Oversees timeline, coordinates team, manages deliverables.
2. Frontend Developers ->	Implements UI components, ensures responsive design.
3. Backend Developers	-> Builds APIs, manages database, implements business logic.
4. Designers ->	Creates mockups, maintains design system, ensures UX quality.
5. QA/Testers ->	Writes test cases, performs testing, reports bugs.
6. DevOps Engineers ->	Manages deployment, CI/CD pipeline, server infrastructure.
7. Product Owner ->	Defines requirements, prioritizes features, represents stakeholders.
8. Scrum Master ->	Facilitates agile processes, removes blockers, organizes meetings.

## UI Component Patterns.

### Planned Components.
Navbar

- Logo
- Search bar
- User navigation
- Responsive menu
  
Property Card

- Property image
- Basic details (price, location, rating)
- Favorite button
- Responsive layout
  
Footer

- Site links
- Company information
- Social media links
- Copyright information

  Each component will be designed for reusability and consistency across the application.


# Answers for Backend (BE)

## Provide a brief overview of the project, including the project goals and the tech stack.
### This project is designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.
### Project goals:

  1. Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.
  2. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  3. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
  4. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
  5. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
  6. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
  7. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.
 
### Tech stack:
- Python, Django, Database system e.g(MySQL), Docker, Github Actions.


## Team Roles and Responsibilities.
1. A business analyst -> Understands the customerâ€™s business processes, translates the customer's business needs into requirements.
2. Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
3. A product owner -> holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution,  Make sure the final product meets customer requirements.
4. A project manager -> makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget, manages and motivates the software development team.
5. A UI/UX designer -> Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs
6. A software architect -> Designs a high-level software architecture, selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision
7. Software developers -> Engineers, and stabilizes the product.
8. Quality assurance engineers -> Makes sure an application performs according to requirements.
9. Test automation engineers -> Design a test automation ecosystem.
10. DevOps engineer -> Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams.
